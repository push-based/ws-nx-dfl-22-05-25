# Exercise: Connect to Nx Cloud

## 1. connect-to-nx-cloud

The first thing we need to do is to connect our workspace to the nx cloud.
In order to do so, you would typically run `nx connect-to-nx-cloud`.

As this would require you to claim this workspace for yourself, we've already prepared this step for.
The only thing that you need to do is to put the following accessToken configuration into the `nx.json`

```json
// nx.json
{
  "nxCloudId": "682dcf0e246aae99cbac4e14"
}
```
